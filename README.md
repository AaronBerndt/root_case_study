# Data Structure
I chose objects just because I'm used to them and while creating the types for them it easier to visualize what they'll be. You can check the types.ts file to see how they're formated.

# Project Assumptions
 - File should always be formated as input.txt
 - File format isn't always correct or could be empty.
 - Command format could have incorrect/missing values or be wrong.
 - Commands can be executed in any order so Trip Dan could come before Driver Dan
 - No duplicate drivers
